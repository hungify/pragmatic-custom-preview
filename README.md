[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/hungify/pragmatic-custom-preview)

A good example of tackling the problems that come with native drag preview items on different browsers and devices.

This project is a [react.js](https://react.dev/) implementation of the [Pragmatic custom preview](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/adapters/element/drag-previews#non-native-custom-drag-previews)

## Running locally

This is fairly vanilla `vue.js` project, so you can run it locally by:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
